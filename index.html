        <h1>Review: ‘Hamilton,’ Young Rebels Changing History and Theater</h1>
        <h3>By Ben Brantley</h3>
        <p>Yes, it really is that good.

            <p>At this point, it would be almost a relief           to report that “Hamilton” — the musical that        opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater on        Thursday night — has shrunk beneath the bloat     of its hype. Since it was first staged at the            Public Theater this year, this brave new show       about America’s founding fathers has been        given the kind of worshipful press usually    reserved for the appearances of          once-in-a-lifetime comets or the births of          little royal celebrities.</p>
            
            <p>During the past several months, while it             was being pumped up and trimmed down for its            move from the East Village to Broadway,         Lin-Manuel Miranda’s rap-driven portrait of         the rise and fall of Alexander Hamilton (this      country’s first secretary of the Treasury) has       been the stuff of encomiums in both fashion           magazines and op-ed columns. A friend of mine           recently said that there were three subjects        she never wanted to see in a newspaper again:         Caitlyn Jenner, the Harper Lee novel “Go Set a      Watchman” and “Hamilton.”</p>

            <p>
               Even I, one of the many critics who enthused about “Hamilton” in February like a born-again convert in a revival tent, was beginning to think, “Enough already.” Then I saw the show at the Richard Rodgers. 

            </p>

            <p>
               I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show. But “Hamilton,” directed by Thomas Kail and starring Mr. Miranda, might just about be worth it — at least to anyone who wants proof that the American musical is not only surviving but also evolving in ways that should allow it to thrive and transmogrify in years to come. 
                
            </p>

            <p>
               A show about young rebels grabbing and shaping the future of an unformed country, “Hamilton” is making its own resonant history by changing the language of musicals. And it does so by insisting that the forms of song most frequently heard on pop radio stations in recent years — rap, hip-hop, R&B ballads — have both the narrative force and the emotional interiority to propel a hefty musical about long-dead white men whose solemn faces glower from the green bills in our wallets.
